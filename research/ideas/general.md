# General Ideas

1. Repositories count should be similar to developer count, it is hard to work on multiple repositories of same project, but for scaling reasons one reository can have multiple deployment
2. Rest API is not always best, grpc is sometimes (or much times) better than rest, the main reason is logical reasoning, when we try to make everything like rest, we lose logical reasoning sometimes
